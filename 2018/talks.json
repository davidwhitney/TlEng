        "description": "There are many theoretical talks about GraphQL out there. They show principles and ideas and while they are really good to Gain some understanding, I believe the best way to learn is to practice. In this workshop you’ll get your hands dirty, we will create a fully functional GraphQL server that delivers live train times departures.We will work our way from creating a dummy server through leveraging all the different resolvers and types. Along the way we will of course explain the principles behind GraphQL and why this technology is awesome. This workshop is for anyone interested in knowing more about GraphQL and want to get started with this technology. You don’t need any previous experience with GraphQL, some javascript exposure assumed, all you need is your lapop and  NodeJS installed.",
