# 2018

Apologies for the messy code, some things of note: 

`index.html` is NOT auto generated, any changes in `talksToHTML` won't affect it, please edit both if possible, otherwise just `index.html`. `talksToHTML` was just a helper to lazily generate some HTML under supervision and then copy pasta it into the index.html for tweaking. (#notoil irony)

Talk Descriptions (to populate the modals) are saved in `assets/js/sched.js` - edit them there

Colors and # of rows are saved in `partials/variables`, gotta compile the scsss in order for changes to take effect. (VSCode has some plugins to do that)
